## 👥 Team Roles

Each member of the development team plays a key part in ensuring that the AirBnB Clone project runs efficiently and meets the required standards.  
Below are the main roles and their responsibilities (inspired by the ITRexGroup blog and our project overview):

### 🧑‍💻 Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core logic of the application.  
They develop RESTful and GraphQL APIs, implement authentication, manage business logic, and ensure integration between the frontend and backend systems.

### 🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Ensures that the database is optimized, secure, and scalable.  
They design database schemas, create indexes for performance, handle migrations, and back up data regularly to prevent data loss.

### ⚙️ DevOps Engineer
Focuses on automation, deployment, and monitoring.  
They build CI/CD pipelines, manage Docker containers, monitor application performance, and ensure smooth deployment across environments.

### 🧪 QA Engineer
Responsible for testing and validating the application.  
They design and execute test cases, perform integration and regression testing, and ensure that all APIs and modules meet quality standards before release.

### 🎨 Frontend Developer
Builds the user-facing interface of the application.  
They integrate backend APIs into a responsive and user-friendly UI, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for users.

### 🧭 Project Manager
Coordinates all team activities and ensures project milestones are achieved.  
They manage timelines, assign tasks, track progress, and facilitate communication between all team members.

Each of these roles contributes to the overall success of the AirBnB Clone project by ensuring that the system is stable, scalable, and user-friendly.
## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project uses a combination of powerful and modern technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend and RESTful APIs.  
It handles routing, authentication, data modeling, and server-side logic.

### 🌐 Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs with serialization, authentication, and permissions support.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
A robust, open-source relational database system used to store and manage data efficiently.  
It supports complex queries, relationships, and data integrity.

### ⚡ GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.  
It provides flexibility and reduces the amount of data transferred between frontend and backend.

### 🐳 Docker
Used for containerization to create consistent development and production environments.  
It simplifies deployment and dependency management.

### 🚀 Celery
A task queue system that handles background tasks like sending notifications and processing payments asynchronously.

### 🔴 Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and as a message broker for Celery tasks.

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate testing and deployment processes.  
They ensure new code is integrated smoothly and deployed reliably.
