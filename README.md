## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project includes several core features that replicate the essential functionality of the real Airbnb platform.  
Each feature is designed to work seamlessly with the backend architecture to deliver a smooth user experience.

### 👤 User Management
This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
It ensures users can securely sign up, log in, update their details, and manage their profiles. Authentication tokens and permissions control access to the system.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings through this feature.  
Each property includes details such as title, description, location, price per night, and available amenities.  
It enables users to search and browse properties based on filters like price, location, and availability.

### 📅 Booking System
The booking system allows users to reserve properties for specific dates.  
It manages availability, prevents overlapping reservations, and stores booking information such as start and end dates.  
Users can view their current and past bookings directly from their profiles.

### 💳 Payment Processing
This feature handles all financial transactions between guests and hosts.  
It ensures secure processing of payments, records each transaction, and updates booking and payment statuses automatically.  
Integration with third-party payment gateways enables smooth and safe transfers.

### ⭐ Review and Rating System
Users can provide feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in.  
This promotes trust and transparency within the platform by allowing guests to share their experiences.  
Hosts can also view and respond to reviews, helping maintain quality and reputation.

### 🔍 Search and Filtering
Users can easily find properties using filters such as location, price, and availability.  
This improves the overall usability and performance of the system by ensuring efficient data retrieval and a better user experience.

### ⚙️ Admin Dashboard (Optional Feature)
Administrators can monitor system activity, manage users, and review property listings.  
This feature helps ensure data integrity, user safety, and proper platform governance.

---

These features collectively make the AirBnB Clone a complete and scalable solution for property rentals, focusing on security, performance, and usability.
## 🔐 API Security

Security is a core component of the AirBnB Clone backend.  
Because the system handles sensitive information such as user credentials, personal details, and payment data, multiple security measures are implemented to protect users and the platform.

### 🪪 Authentication
Authentication ensures that only verified users can access the system.  
It uses secure login methods (e.g., JWT or token-based authentication) to confirm a user’s identity before granting access.  
This prevents unauthorized users from viewing or modifying protected data.

### 🔏 Authorization
Authorization controls what authenticated users are allowed to do.  
For example, a host can manage their own property listings, while a guest can only make bookings.  
This separation of permissions protects data integrity and prevents privilege abuse.

### 📊 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting prevents excessive requests from a single source, which could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  
By limiting the number of API calls per user or IP address, the system maintains stability and prevents misuse of server resources.

### 🔐 Data Encryption
All sensitive data — such as passwords, tokens, and payment information — is encrypted in transit and at rest.  
HTTPS (SSL/TLS) is used for secure communication between the client and server, ensuring that data cannot be intercepted or tampered with.
## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It's an automated approach to software development that enables teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** involves automatically building and testing code changes whenever developers commit to the repository. This helps catch bugs early and ensures that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.

**Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)** automates the release process, allowing tested code to be deployed to production environments quickly and safely.

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project

- **Code Quality**: Automated testing ensures that bugs are caught before they reach production
- **Faster Development**: Automated builds and deployments reduce manual work and speed up delivery
- **Consistency**: Standardized processes ensure every deployment follows the same steps
- **Early Bug Detection**: Issues are identified immediately when code is committed
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, frequent updates are easier to troubleshoot than large releases
- **Team Collaboration**: Everyone works with the latest, tested version of the code

### Tools for CI/CD Implementation

#### GitHub Actions
- Native integration with GitHub repositories
- Workflow automation for testing, building, and deployment
- Free tier available for public repositories
- YAML-based configuration for defining pipelines

#### Docker
